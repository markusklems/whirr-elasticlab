# Expert: override Hadoop properties by setting properties with the prefix
# hadoop-common, hadoop-hdfs, hadoop-mapreduce to set Common, HDFS, MapReduce
# site properties, respectively. The prefix is removed by Whirr, so that for
# example, setting 
# hadoop-common.fs.trash.interval=1440
# will result in fs.trash.interval being set to 1440 in core-site.xml.
